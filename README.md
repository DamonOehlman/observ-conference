# observ-conference

An experimental implementation of an
[Observ](https://github.com/Raynos/Observ) that works with an
[rtc-quickconnect](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-quickconnect) conference
instance.

__NOTE:__ This was some early experimentation around combining rtc.io
packages and observables.  We are working on an implementation which
is generally more useful...
